Description: C++ classes to embed R in C++ applications
 The RInside packages makes it easier to have 'R inside' your
 C++ application by providing a few wrapper classes.
 .
 As R itself is embedded into your application, a shared library 
 build of R is required. This works on Linux, OS X and even on 
 Windows provided you use the same tools used to build R itself.
 .
 Several examples are provided in the examples/ directory of
 the installed package, and Doxygen-generated documentation of
 the C++ classes is included as well.
Depends: R (>= 2.10.0), Rcpp (>= 0.7.10)
