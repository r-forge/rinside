2010-02-23  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* src/RInside.cpp: Add new parseEval() member function returning a SEXP
	* src/RInside.h: idem

	* src/inst/examples/standard/rinside_sample8.cpp: Show new parseEval()

2010-02-17  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* inst/examples/mpi/: Add examples contributed by Jianping Hua
	* inst/examples/: Update two existing examples to new Rcpp API

2010-02-12  Romain Francois <romain@r-enthusiasts.com>

	* src/MemBuf.h: MemBuf simplified using std::string

	* src/RInside.h: RInside gains an operator[](string) to allow
	treating the RInside instance as a proxy to the global environment
	so that we can do: RInside R; R["x"] = 10 ; All the actual work
	is done by the Rcpp::Environment class

2010-02-04  Romain Francois <francoisromain@free.fr>

	* RInside::autoloads revisited with the new Rcpp api

	* RInside gains a default constructor to be used when there
	is no command line arguments

2010-01-28  Romain Francois <francoisromain@free.fr>

	* src/RInside.{h,cpp}: Retire assign(vector<vector<double>> )
	because now this can be taken care of by template specialization

	* DESCRIPTION: require Rcpp 0.7.3.6

2010-01-28  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* src/RInside.{h,cpp}: Restore assign(vector<vector<double>>) which
	  is not (yet?) covered by the more general templated solution

	* src/RInside.h: Minor cleanup regarding logTxt usage

	* src/Makefile: Make sure we find Rcpp.h headers

2010-01-27  Romain Francois <francoisromain@free.fr>

	* src/RInside.{h,cpp}: include Rcpp.h and use the Rf_ prefixed R API
	functions. stop using macros from Rdefines because they don't
	work with R_NOREMAP

	* src/RInside.{h,cpp}: using the new Rcpp API assign becomes
	a template and let Rcpp::Environment.assign deal with the type
	of the object and how to wrap it. specializations of wrap
	for vector<vector<int>> and vector<vector<double>> are created
	to maintain original interface.

2010-01-06  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* DESCRIPTION: Increase Version: to 0.2.1

	* src/RInside.cpp: Change startup so that interactive() comes out FALSE,
	  with that no longer call Rf_KillAllDevices(); as we may not have
	  had devices in the first place.

	* src/RInside.h: Logging helper protected by #ifndef as it is in Rcpp too

	* tools/unix2dos.r: Simple CRLF -> LF filter to nuke a Windows warning

	* inst/THANKS: Added Richard for all the initial help with Windows

	* src/RInside.cpp: Uncommented fpu_setup() for now

	* inst/doc/{html,man.latex}: Removed autogenerated doxygen files from
	  svn as they are too volatile, will remain in tarball as for Rcppccd 

2009-12-16  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* src/tools/RInsideEnvVars.r: Deal with slashed on Windows platform

2009-12-15  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* DESCRIPTION: Remove 'OS_type: unix' as we now build and run on Windoze
	* src/Makefile.win: src/RInside.h, src/RInside.cpp: Added support for
	  building on Windows using the standard MinGW toolchain
	* src/setenv.c: Windows implementation of setenv() kindly provided by
	  Richard Holbrey during earlier attempts to build on Windows
        * inst/examples/Makefile.win: Similarly Makefile for Windows examples

2009-12-12  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* src/RInside.cpp: Destructor does a few additional things as per the
	  R_Cleanup example in section 8.1.2 on 'Setting R callbacks'

	* DESCRIPTION: Increase Version: to 0.1.1

	* inst/THANKS: Added new file to say Thank You! to contributors

	* inst/examples/Makefile: set R_HOME variable to output of 'R RHOME',
	  use R_HOME to call R as R_HOME/bin/R, use R instead of Rscript,
	  query R about CXX and CPPFLAGS, general editing and overhaul

	* inst/examples/*.cpp: More consistent formatting using Emacs 'M-x untabify'

2009-09-11  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* src/Makefile: Enhanced to now automatically regenerate the two
	  R-derived header files, and to also query R for directories which
	  should make the build more portable across different systems

	* src/MemBuf/cpp: Switch error message from fprintf to std::cerr
	  to avoid unncessary trouble with g++-4.4, with thanks to
	  Michael Kane for the heads-up

	* R/RInsidePaths.R: Added path helper functions called by Makefiles
	* NAMESPACE: Added (empty) file so we can call 'path helpers'

	* inst/examples/Makefile: Rewritten to no longer used fixed path
	  settings but rather query R, Rcpp and RInside
