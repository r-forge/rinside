2009-09-11  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* src/Makefile: Enhanced to now automatically regenerate the two
	  R-derived header files, and to also query R for directories which
	  should make the build more portable across different systems

	* src/MemBuf/cpp: Switch error message from fprintf to std::cerr
	  to avoid unncessary trouble with g++-4.4, with thanks to
	  Michael Kane for the heads-up

	* R/RInsidePaths.R: Added path helper functions called by Makefiles
	* NAMESPACE: Added (empty) file so we can call 'path helpers'

	* inst/examples/Makefile: Rewritten to no longer used fixed path
	  settings but rather query R, Rcpp and RInside

2009-07-28  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* inst/examples/rinside_sample2.cpp: Another simple example inspired
	  by a long thread on r-devel

2009-07-28  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* src/RInside.cpp: Added patch by Daniel F Schwarz to not set env
 	  vars with prior values (to e.g. allow non-standard R_HOME)

2009-07-19  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* src/MemBuf.cpp: Added one-line patch by Miguel Lechón in add()
	  method to correctly re-set pointer---with a bug Thanks! to Miguel

	  vectors of types double, int and string, as well as int matrices

	  illustrate and test the bug reported by Miguel Lechón
